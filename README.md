# GNU PLot Realtime Plotting


# Execute files in this order:

1. `./generateData`
2. `./plot`
3. Provide an adequate `bin/showFreeMemory` implementation for your system.

`data.dat` is a sample data file as it should be generated by `bin/showFreeMemory`.

# Caution

As long as `generateData' is run, `data.dat' is filled up with datapoints
and grows in size. To stop this, kill the process associated with
`generateData'.
